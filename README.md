# SwiftUI Flows

A cross-Apple-platform library enabling the native SwiftUI full-screens & sheet-styled modals, half-modals, arbitrary-sized models, and popovers.

Why SwiftUIFlows?
- Extract navigation from the Views
- Do it declaratively, no need to introduce tedious flags `@State private var isPresentingMyScreen = false` anymore.
- Show up to 9 Views subsequently, when you need it
- Writing Flows is so simple they will actually take considerably less time to implement at scale, because you don't need to write callbacks and dismissals yourself.
- Provides handy methods to do actions
- No analogs, seriously, check it out :)

Features:
- Structured concurrency
- Lightweight, no dependencies, made with KISS in mind
- 

TODO:

- Turn on/off animations
- Test thoroughly
