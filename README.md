üöÄ SwiftUIFlows: Ultimate Navigation for Apple Ecosystem üçé

Seamlessly present modal screens, popups, and more in SwiftUI, across iOS and Mac!

üì± What Can SwiftUIFlows Do?

- Full-screen Displays: Dive into immersive content.
- Sheet-styled Modals: Classic, yet elegant.
- Custom-sized Modals: Your size, your rules.
- Popovers: The cherry on top for contextual info.

üåü Why Choose SwiftUIFlows?

 - Declarative & Clean: Say goodbye to scattered navigation logic and constant flag checking, like @State private var isPresentingMyScreen = false.
 - Streamlined Flows: Easy-to-write navigation flows that save you time and reduce boilerplate. No more manual callbacks and dismissals.
 - Multiple Modals: Show any number of modals in a view, and control their presentation and dismissal with ease.
 - Custom Popups: Design and present popups as unique as your app.

üí° Features At A Glance:

 - Light & Swift: Zero dependencies. Built with the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.
 - Cross-Platform: Designed for both iOS and Mac.
 - Supercharged Fullscreen & Popups: Uses ZStack for native, enhanced presentations.
 - Limitless Customization: Style it, modify it, make it yours.


## Simple FlowBuilder Example:

```
@MainActor class ExampleFlow: FlowBuilder {
    func presentSomePopup()  {
         presentPopup(Example1View(showDismiss: true, flow: self))
    }

    func presentFullScreen()  {
         presentFullScreen(Example2View(showDismiss: true, flow: self))
    }

    func presentAnotherPopup()  {
         presentPopup(Example3View(showDismiss: true, flow: self))
    }
}
```

}
```

## More Avdanced FlowBuilder Example:
```
import SwiftUIFlows

@MainActor class RootFlow: FlowBuilder {
    
    func showVerified(viewModel: AuthVM)  {
         presentFullScreen(
            VerifiedView(viewModel: viewModel, completion: { [weak self] in
                self?.dismissFullScreen()
            })
        )
    }
    
    func showAnythingYouWant(view: AnyView)  {
         presentFullScreen(
            view
                .onAppear {
                        self.dismissFullScreen()
                }
